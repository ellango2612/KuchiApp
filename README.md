## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

A list of my favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app:
1. Instagram
- Contains lots of visual features (images)
- Interactive -> enable communicating with other users

An app idea that I would like to build:

LearnNewWords app. It is a language learning app that enables users to learn different languages unfamiliar to them. It might be interactive (allowing users to communicate with one another) or not. It should have lots of visual aids (images) for language learning and also audio features like google translate.


## Notes

I had troubles understanding and getting around to play with Swift ans Swift code, but thanks to the book I read and the thorough tutorial, I was able to get to this point.
